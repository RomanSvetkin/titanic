This kernel is for all aspiring data scientists to learn from and to review their knowledge. We will have a detailed statistical analysis of Titanic data set along with Machine learning model implementation. I am super excited to share my first kernel with the Kaggle community. As I go on in this journey and learn new topics, I will incorporate them with each new updates. 

# Kernel Goals
<a id="aboutthiskernel"></a>
***
There are three primary goals of this kernel.
- <b>Do a statistical analysis</b> of how some group of people was survived more than others. 
- <b>Do an exploratory data analysis(EDA)</b> of titanic with visualizations and storytelling.  
- <b>Predict</b>: Use machine learning classification models to predict the chances of passengers survival.
